Lifetime is an app designed to allow users to record and reflect on events, moods, and thoughts throughout their every day lives.
Entering daily reflections will help users grow to better understand their emotions, perceptions, behaviors, and ultimately themselves.
Users will be able to create customizable daily entries and note anything they would like to about their day. Users will also be able to
access entries from previous days as well as edit and delete any entries they have created.
